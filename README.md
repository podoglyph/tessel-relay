# tessel-toggle-onboard-leds

A starter-app to connect the Tessel 2 with a ReactJS client. This app allows the user to toggle the Tessel 2's onboard red, amber, green, and blue led lights from a browser. Also, just in case your Tessel isn't within range of your eyeballs, the app supports a USB camera connected to the Tessel 2 so you can confirm that the lights do indeed toggle. Or point the camera somewhere else and get video of your Tessel 2's surroundings.

The repo for the React client is [here](https://github.com/podoglyph/tessel-toggle-leds-deployable "ReactJS Client").
